# Python_Stenography_Functions
At the moment, this repository has python functions to do stenography on .png files with no alpha channel and in RGB mode.

I plan to add some more later.

The purpose of this repository is to both provide useful functions, and to teach coders about stenography.

# Notes
PNG files tend to be easier to work with than JPG because PNG has "lossless compression".
