# Python_Stenography_Functions
At the moment, this repository has python functions to do stenography on .png files with no alpha channel and in RGB mode.

I plan to add some more later.

The purpose of this repository is to both provide useful functions, and to teach coders about stenography.

# Notes
The (PNG + RGB + Image Channels == 3) test worked!
The code was tested on the following image: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6a/PNG_Test.png

PNG files tend to be easier to work with than JPG because PNG has "lossless compression".
